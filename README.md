Design a 512-bit processor with the following three components:

1. A register file with 4 512-bit registers named A1 to A4 that can store data. This register file should be capable of performing addition and multiplication operations with inputs from A1 and A2, outputting the result in A3. The output from A3 should be able to be transferred to A4.
2. A memory with a depth of 512 and a width of 32 bits. This memory should be capable of storing 16 consecutive addresses from memory in one instruction cycle.
3. A set of instructions for this processor that includes:
   - Storing data from one of the registers into memory
   - Loading data from memory into one of the registers
   - Adding and multiplying data from the registers and storing the result back into one of the registers

Design your circuit and ensure its correctness by testing it for edge cases. Pay attention to additional requirements like flags and processor states.
